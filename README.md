## Features

- Object detection in images using the MobileNet SSD model.
- Object detection in videos with real-time processing capabilities.
- Easy to extend and integrate with additional models or functionalities.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/heinhtoonaing/AI_ImageProcessing.git
   cd AI_ImageProcessing
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment**:
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. **Install the required packages**:
   Ensure you have `opencv-python`, `numpy`, and any other dependencies installed:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python numpy
   ```

5. **Download the pre-trained model**:
   Place the `MobileNetSSD_deploy.caffemodel` and `MobileNetSSD_deploy.prototxt` files in the `models` directory. You can find these files from [the MobileNet SSD repository](https://github.com/chuanqi305/MobileNet-SSD).

## Usage

1. **Run the object detection on an image**:
   ```bash
   python src/object_detection.py
   ```

2. **Run the object detection on a video**:
   ```bash
   python src/video_object_detection.py
   ```

   - You can change the video source in the `video_object_detection.py` script to use a different video file or a webcam.
